# Ghost Tactics

Ghost Tactics is an innovative auto chess experience that emphasizes lightweight player strategy and real-time 3D combat mechanics, playable both online and offline. It is developed using a tech stack comprising **Unity 3D** and **C#** for the frontend, with support for Android and PC, and **Django** on Python with a **MySQL** database for the backend. Key features include AI battles without internet connectivity, 3D real-time battle scenes for enhanced expressiveness, and a simplified multiplayer online system for easy game room joining and hosting.


## Technical Stack Overview

### Frontend

- Development Environment: Windows 10
- Game Design Languages and Frameworks: Unity (Version: 2020.3.3f1c1 LTS) and C# for game interface development and character mechanics scripting. Unity3D was chosen for its short development cycle, rich module library, and ease of multi-platform deployment, making it ideal for rapid development. C#, with its syntax similar to C/C++ and modern object-oriented design principles, allows for quick learning and development.
- Client-Side Runtime Environment: Android 10 or higher
- Client-Side Development Toolkits: Java JDK and Android SDK for application adaptation and development.

### Backend

- System: Ubuntu (Version: 20.04.1)
- Programming Language: Python (Version: 3.8.5)
- Framework: Django (Version: 3.2), chosen for its low coupling, rapid development, and ease of deployment. Django's robust database management capabilities and elegant URL design patterns facilitate agile development and clear API design.

### Database

- System: MySQL (Version: 8.0.23), selected for its stability, compatibility, and ease of use. Its integration with Django supports efficient backend development.
